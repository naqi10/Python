# Python
Hey there! Welcome to my personal coding adventure! This repository is where I’m documenting my journey to learn Python, one day at a time. Starting today, June 10, 2025, I’ll be adding a new code file or notebook each day to explore different programming concepts. It’s a mix of practice, experimentation, and fun, and I’m excited to share it with anyone who might find it helpful or inspiring!


What’s the Plan?
I’m tackling a new topic every day, creating a separate file for each one to keep things organized. The idea is to build my skills step by step, from basics to more advanced stuff. You can follow along with my progress, see what I’m learning, and even suggest topics for future days!
